But itâ€™s important to put these claims in the context that wind turbines arenâ€™t the only eagle-killers. Eagles can also die from automobiles, power lines, guns, and the effects of climate change. Weâ€™re building wind turbines in part to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and alleviate climate change.

Peer-reviewed studies and ongoing AEFI surveillance using systems such as the US-based Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) show that adverse events continue to be monitored post-licensure. However, the WHOâ€™s AEFI protocol is not implemented by the US healthcare system, so it does not make sense to claim that the protocol enables the US government to cover up vaccine deaths.",health,fake

The claim that COVID-19 is no more dangerous than the flu is based on a misinterpretation of the WHOâ€™s estimate that a maximum of 10% of the global population has been infected by the virus that causes COVID-19. Calculating IFR with the upper bound of the WHOâ€™s estimate and recent infection data underestimates the global COVID-19 IFR, which according to current estimates, is at least ten times higher than that of the flu. In addition to lethality, its global distribution, lack of vaccines or effective treatments, and potential long-term damage to survivors make COVID-19 a more significant danger compared to the flu.",health,fake
